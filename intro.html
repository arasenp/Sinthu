    <h2> I kind of lied slightly to you, a little white lie there was never a wrong answer, all of them were correct,<br>
    these marked the best memories which I had with you on the island that made me extremely <br>
    attached to you and fall for you even more to the point that I think of you everyday. <br>
    The above are my favourite pictures so far with you and soon, we'll have more. </h1>
